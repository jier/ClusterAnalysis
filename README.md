# ClusterAnalysis

This is the last BÃ¨ta-Gamma project at the UVA  usually done by a third year major student together with different major students.
The aim of this project is to analyse a problem/situation and then to approach it with different view of embarged major students.
The different view need then to be integrated in one interdisciplinary research that will result in a paper. 

So 
So this Cluster analysis' goal is to give a proof of concept to the idea of analysing formed star clusters with their label-
a thing previously done by hand as the googlezoo project- by using deeplearning. Deep learning here would be use in term of 
building convolutional networks as in mimicking how the human eye percept image- this contribution is due to the neurobiological
major student. 

In order to achieve this goal, an architecture is needed and also the hidden layers where mathematical transformation will mimick 
the communication between neurons. Because the data used are astronomical ones; these data are invariant of rotation,scalte transformation
nor translation to a certain extend. This property is useful when using data augmentation. The size of our database for this analysis will be
of hundred labelled pictures in .png format; because of the labelling of the pictures, it has been difficult to have a bigger database as in 
all labelling has been done by hand.
